	 Kareena Kapoor got massively trolled on social media after a picture of her supporting the #JusticeForOurChild campaign went viral. Kareena's picture holding a placard which read, "I am Hindustan. I am Ashamed. #JusticeForOurChild..." was posted on social media by her Veere Di Wedding co-star Swara Bhasker. On Swara Bhasker's post, which has been liked over 2.3K times on Twitter, several users had slammed the Udta Punjab actress and wrote comments like, "She should be ashamed for being a Hindu married to a Muslim" and "fake liberal." In response to a user, Swara wrote, "You should be ashamed you exist. That God gave you a brain which you chose to fill with hate and a mouth you chose to spew filth from. You are a shame on India and Hindus. That shits like you feel emboldened to talk this crap publicly is this government's legacy." The picture was posted in wake of the nationwide outrage over the rape and murder of eight-year-old in Kathua.

<b><p >For most of the world, anything that Kylie Jenner does makes news. Apart from dropping frequent bombshells about baby Stormi Webster and showing up in bodacious outfits, Kylie's especially well known for her influence in the beauty sphere. Her mega popular beauty brand and their every new launch is proof enough of that. The young mom also never misses an opportunity to debut a new look and like the clever Kardashian always picks the right time to do that.
	This time around, that has turned out to be at Coachella. Like most of the Hollywood's young stars, Kylie attended the music festival over the weekend and made the most of it by debuting a new hair colour, which in all likelihood is an excellently crafted wig. Like Kylie herself, the colour was a bright, bold pink, which you could probably see from four towns away.
	
	 
	Post the birth of her baby girl in February, Kylie has been busy launching new collections and posing with her tot but hadn't updated her jet black locks until now. Stormi's mom posed with her flat neon pink locks wearing a white bandeau top and a shiny tan suit. We've got to say that there's something so appealing about that hot pink and muted neutral combination.
	
	 
	But if you think it ended there, then you aren't a Kylie fan at all. Of course she didn't stop at just one colour. King Kylie worked the tress game by going on the complete other end of the spectrum with a muted blue bob, paired with a strapless short body suit.
	
	 
	And as if she could read out minds, she went ahead and changed things up yet again with a longer locks in a different tone which she gave us a closeup of. If you were wondering what exact hue of blue it is, she gives you an answer by captioning it "denim blue". Along with it is a brown toned makeup look, beautifully defined brows, a few necklaces and obviously, the full-lipped Kylie Jenner pout.</p></b>
