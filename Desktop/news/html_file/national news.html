    <h3>Military officials said India is also strengthening its surveillance mechanism to keep an eye on Chinese activities along the borders in the strategically sensitive Tibetan region.</h3>
    <img id="photos"src="../images_file/army.jpg" width="50%" height="70%" style=" float: left;" />
    <p style="display: inline; line-height: 1.5em; "><b>KIBITHU, ARUNACHAL PRADESH:  India has deployed more troops and significantly increased patrolling in the mountainous terrains of Dibang, Dau-Delai and Lohit valleys along the borders with China in the Tibetan region in Arunachal sector following the Doklam face-off, the most tense military confrontation between the two countries in decades.
    
        Military officials said India is also strengthening its surveillance mechanism to keep an eye on Chinese activities along the borders in the strategically sensitive Tibetan region and has even been regularly deploying choppers to carry out recce.
        
        They said India has been focusing on dominating the treacherous terrains which include snow-clad mountains at an altitude of over 17,000 feet, and river passes, as part of a strategy to counter China's rising assertiveness along the border in Dibang, Dau-Delai and Lohit valleys.
        
        "Post Doklam, we have increased our activities manifold. We are fully prepared to deal with any challenge," said an army officer posted in Kibithu, the eastern most village on India's border with China's Tibetan region.
        
        The official said the Army has been enhancing its Long Range Patrols (LRPs) where troops in small groups go for patrols for 15-30 days as part of an overall approach to maintain the sanctity of the Line of Actual Control, the de-facto border between India and China.
        
        Troops of India and China were locked in a 73-day standoff in Doklam from June 16 last year after the Indian side stopped building of a road in the disputed area by the Chinese Army. The face-off ended on August 28.
        
        "We have increased our deployment of troops while focusing on all the strategically important areas including a tri-junction among India, China and Myanmar," said the official who wished not to be named as he is not authorised to speak to the media.

        The official said China has been ramping up its infrastructure development along India's border, particularly in the Tibetan region and there was a need for India to enhance its road network for quick movements of troops.
        
        The Army uses a foot suspension bridge to carry its military supplies to its Kibithu post, considered very important from operational point of view, as the only road connecting the East bank of Lohit river with West bank remains closed due to landslides for most part of the year.
        
        However, a senior official of the Border Roads Organisation said a number of roads including one to connect the Dibang Valley with Lohit Valley has been finalised which will improve the inter-valley connectivity in Arunachal.
        
        China has been laying new roads and improving its overall infrastructure along the nearly 4,000 km long border with India.
        
        Earlier this month, Defence Minister Nirmala Sitharaman had said China has undertaken construction of helipads, sentry posts and trenches for its army personnel near Doklam.
        
        COMMENTSSources said China has been keeping its troops in north Doklam and significantly ramping up its infrastructure in the disputed area.
        
        In January, Army Chief General Bipin Rawat had said the time had come for India to shift its focus from borders with Pakistan to the frontier with China, indicating the seriousness of the situation.</b>

    <img id="photos"src="../images_file/nat1.jpg"  width="50%" height"200px" alt="Kathua"style=" float: left;"/>
    
    <p style="display: inline; line-height: 1.5em;"><b>New Delhi:  The father of the eight-year-old girl who was raped and murdered in Jammu and Kashmir's Kathua requested the Supreme Court today to transfer the trial to Chandigarh, citing a "backlash" and lack of security for his family.
    
        "We are apprehensive that the trial will not happen peacefully, seeing the condition in Jammu... Seeing that lawyers opposed it in Kathua and did not let the chargesheet proceed," the family's lawyer said.
        
        
        The trial began today against eight men charged in the brutal killing in January. Six of them, including a former revenue official, two police officers and a minor, are accused of keeping the little girl sedated and without food in a small temple for days, raping her over and over and finally killing her.
         
        
        India spoke up in one voice against the horrific gang-rape and killing of 8-year-old girl in Kathua
        A police chargesheet says the murder was carefully planned by the retired official, Sanji Ram, to drive the girl's nomadic Muslim community out of Kathua's Rasana village. The country was left in shock after a police charge-sheet exposed the horror of what the child suffered before her death.
        
        For three months, some groups and local politicians had been backing the accused and demanding a CBI probe. The Jammu Bar Association, whose members also participated in these rallies, say they are not satisfied with the police investigation and want a CBI investigation.
         
        
        Prime Minister Narendra Modi's had said "no culprit will be spared, complete justice will be done."
        Two BJP ministers were forced to quit Chief Minister Mehbooba Mufti's cabinet for backing a rally in favour of the accused organised by a group called the Hindu Ekta Manch in March.
        
        Chandra Prakash Ganga had allegedly termed the arrest as "jungle raj", Lal Singh had said: "Why such a hullabaloo on the death of this one girl... many such girls have died here".
        
        Their exit followed Prime Minister Narendra Modi's sharp comments last Thursday. "I want to assure the country that no culprit will be spared, complete justice will be done. Our daughters will definitely get justice," PM Modi said at an event.</b>
